# Monte-Carlo-Integration
This program takes a given function of x and determines an approximation of the integral by "throwing darts" in an area around the function. 
If the dart hits on or under the function, a running counter is incremented and used to find the percentage of darts that land under the function.
This percentage is then multiplied by the area around the function to produce an approximation of the integral of the function.
The theory is the more darts that are thrown, the better the approximation of the integral is.
